            I am a developer with 5 years of experience working on a real-world mobile banking application. My journey
            began with maintaining a Cordova-based app using JavaScript, jQuery, and Core Java. Over time, I realized I
            wanted to do more than just fix bugs — I wanted to build things from the ground up.<br><br>

            Now, I’m focused on becoming a full-stack developer. I’m currently upskilling in modern web technologies
            like React, Node.js, and responsive UI design. I love creating clean, intuitive interfaces and writing code
            that’s easy to understand and maintain.<br><br>

            I learn best by building, and I’m actively working on personal projects to sharpen my skills.
